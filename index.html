                              <p style="text-align: justify;" >Serverless technology has emerged as one of the most talked-about technologies in recent years. The concept of using APIs to build and run applications without having to provision and manage infrastructure has captured the imagination of developers and CIOs alike. The ability to build applications in almost any language without having to think about infrastructure plumbing has opened new opportunities for developers, while the ability to scale up and down automatically on demand has radically simplified operations and DevOps. And the close integration with the world's biggest public clouds has opened new opportunities for CIOs to reduce their datacenter footprint and increase their agility.</p>

                              <p>Increased businesses are turning to serverless technology as a way of building their infrastructure and managing their applications more efficiently. Serverless is an emerging field that allows developers to build applications and services without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This means they can focus on building their applications instead of managing servers. Serverless functions can be triggered by events, such as an HTTP request or a database update, and can run in the background without the need for developers to continuously manage them.
                              </p>

                              <p>The concept of serverless technology has been around for quite time, and it has been making significant advancements over the years. It all started with the first “serverless” applications – the Amazon AWS Lambda platform, which was launched in 2014. Lambda was a fully managed service that allowed developers to build code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Lambda was a major step forward in making it possible for businesses to build applications without having to worry about the servers that ran them.</p>

                              <p>Serverless devops is just another way of doing devops. It also removes the complexity and cost of managing servers. Serverless is great for cloud platforms but also for on-premises infrastructure. It is a key part of a cloud-first or cloud-native approach to IT.</p>

                              <p>Serverless is the epitome of the principle of Kiss (Keep it simple stupid). It allows for simple, dependable, and cheap computing. This allows teams to complete complex tasks easily. Which is potentially their greatest strength, the simplicity to deploy apps in less than a minute, where anyone would have to be focused on maintaining servers.</p>

                                    <li>Security: Despite its advantages, one major disadvantage is that does not provide any security features by default. Serverless applications are not automatically protected from common threats like DDoS or brute force attacks, which means developers must take steps to protect their applications themselves.</li>
                                    <li>Agil: it allows us to quickly deploy and destroy without requiring any maintenance. This allows teams to quickly iterate on innovative ideas and experiment with recent technologies without having to worry about the infrastructure costs and complexity. This higher level of agility makes it easier for teams to experiment with current ideas and reduces the risk of being left behind by the latest industry trends.</li>
                                    <li>Scalability: the technology let us to scaled up or down according to the requirements of the application. This allows teams to quickly scale their applications to meet the demands of peak periods without having to worry about the infrastructure costs and complexity.</li>
                                    <li>Availability: One of the most significant disadvantages is its lack of availability. Because they are not automatically available all the time. This means that developers must constantly monitor their applications to make sure they are available, which is a significant burden for DevOps teams and takes away from their ability to focus on other tasks. </li>
                                    <li>Uncoupled: its lack of coupling produces new problem, because it is difficult for teams to monitor the performance of individual servers and applications, which can make it challenging to troubleshoot performance problems. This makes it harder for teams to identify and resolve underlying issues that are causing performance issues, which can lead to a prominent level of operational complexity.</li>
                                    <li>Real time: They are not limited by the availability of servers, which means developers can build real-time functionality into their applications without having to worry about the latency caused by the availability of servers. This allows teams to build applications with real-time functionality, which was previously impossible due to the constraints of traditional architecture.</li>
                                    <li>Simplicity: this technology allows developers to build complex applications quickly and easily. This makes it easier for teams to build and maintain complex applications, which is potentially their greatest strength, the simplicity to deploy apps in less than a minute, where anyone would have to be focused on maintaining servers.</li>
                                    <li>Modularity: due to the services that are grouped into modular building blocks, it is possible for teams to replace individual building blocks with different technologies without affecting the other building blocks. This makes it possible to upgrade individual building blocks over time as modern technologies become available without having to upgrade the entire architecture at once.</li>
                                    <li>Reusability: it allows teams to build complex applications quickly and easily by breaking them down into smaller building blocks that can be reused across multiple applications.</li>
                                    <li>Independent: due to the great offer of providers like AWS, you can easily build your own application on any cloud infrastructure and even choose more than once.</li>
                                 </ul>
                              </p>

                              <p>The true promise of serverless technology will only be realized when it is possible to build complex server applications using serverless technologies, which will eliminate the complexity and constraints of traditional architectures. Until then, serverless architecture will primarily be used to build smaller, easier to maintain, real-time applications that do not require the high availability or high performance of traditional architectures. But the important thing is that the potential of serverless technology is unlimited, and the future is bright for serverless architectures!</p>
